# LanguageInterpreter
A Language Interpreter written in Rust

The purpose of the project is only to improve my knowledge of the Rust language, but this can be used to learn the basics of language interpreters.

As of now, it implements a subset of the Pascal language. See some examples in ```test``` directory.

Compile with ```cargo build``` and run with ```cargo run /path/to/script.pascal```
